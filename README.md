Description
----

Cash Caretaker is a finance tracker that will keep track of all of your bank accounts and credit cards in one place. You will no longer have to deal with multiple apps to keep track of your accounts at the bank, and each of your different credit cards. With this personal checkbook you will be able to record all of your financial information to get a quick overview of all of your money at once.
All information for Cash Caretaker is entered by the user, and stored locally on the device. This app is not tied to your actual bank accounts in any way.
